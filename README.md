# Homecooked - Recipe Database

## Description

We created `Homecooked` because we wanted to make a professional-looking website that would aid users in the storage and sharing of recipes.

We wanted to create an application that would allow users to edit a recipe, add a recipe, look up a recipe and find the corresponding ingredients and instructions. Each recipe would contain the original author, ingredients, cooking instructions, food category, and food style that the meal fits into. 

Through the course of this project, we gained a deeper understanding of `Model-View-Controllers`, `Object Relational Mapping`, `Express`, and `SQL`. Through them the development of a full stack webpage was and a deeper understanding of how the components interlock and interact with each other.
